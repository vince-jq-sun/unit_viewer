## Introduction

Units Viewer is a tool tailored for researchers working with datasets composed of multiple units, such as neurons. It is ideal for handling large datasets, offering streamlined navigation through figures, easy tagging, and flexible filtering options. This tool allows you to build better intuition through efficient and organized inpection of each unit.

facilitates the building of intuition by allowing efficient and organized inspection of each unit.

## Features

- View detailed profiles of individual neurons.
- Customizable tags and notes for every unit.
- Flexible filtering based on tags to streamline the inspection process.
- Easy navigation through large datasets.
- Local web-based interface for easy access.

## Installation

This project is built with Node.js. Before starting, ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can find instructions in our [Node.js Installation Guide](install_node.md) (generated by chatGPT).

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `units_viewer` folder to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
4. Place your unit images in the `./units_figures` directory, organized by subfolders named with unit IDs.
5. Optionally, place your custom `tags.json` file in `./units_tags`. This file should be a JSON-formatted dictionary where keys are unit IDs, and values are lists of tags or notes (notes prefixed by `%`).

## Usage

### Starting the Viewer

1. Ensure that the images are correctly placed in their respective folders.
2. From the terminal or your IDE, navigate to the `units_viewer` directory and execute `npm start`. This will open the viewer in your default web browser.
3. If it does not automatically open, you can manually access it by visiting [localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024).
4. If there is no `.json` file in `./units_tags`, you can create a new one by clicking __New Tag File__. Consider adding the names of all image folders as keys to this new file by clicking __Fill All__.

### Navigation and Tagging

- Navigate though units by clicking __↑__ for the previous, __↓__ for the next, corresponding to _Ctrl_ + _1_ and _Ctrl_ + _2_ respectively.
- Tags can be added or removed by entering the tag in the text box and clicking __+__ or __-__.
- Notes can be added by prefixing the text with `%` and clicking `+`.
- To switch to a different tag file, select `xx.json` in the dropdown list, then click __Load__

### Filtering

- Use the input box and <u>Filter<u> unit IDs and tags. 
- Quoted strings will match parts of unit IDs while unquoted strings represent tags. 
- Supports logical operations like `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `!` (NOT), with priorities: `!` > `&` > `|`
- To reset the filter and include all units, submit an empty query.
